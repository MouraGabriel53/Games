# 🎮 About Games
Here you can see my basic Python projects about games. They are basic, just for fun in a bad and rainy day :-)

## 🌟 Features |  **Number Guessing Game** 

- The computer selects a random number within a range.
- The player tries to guess the number, receiving hints about whether the number is higher or lower.
- The game continues until the player guesses correctly.

## 🛠️ Tools and Requirements

- **C++** to compile and run the code.
- **IDE or compiler**: Use your favorite C++ compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, etc.).
